# Proj: Signal Vs Hook

This project highlights the benefits of using Signals over the traditional Hook + State method for DOM Manipulation.

## Setting up the project

To start the demo, make sure you clone this repo by running the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/TheAntiNerd/proj-signal-vs-hooks.git
```

And then open the folder

```
cd proj-signal-vs-hooks/
```

Now, install the dependencies for the project by running,

```
npm i
```

And now to finally start the project run,

```
npm run dev
```

This will spin up a development server at `http://localhost:5173/`, from where you will be able to navigate and see the code in action.

## Signal sample code

I have also included a sample code that can be used as a base template for your projects in the `src` folder with the name `SignalCodeExample.jsx`
